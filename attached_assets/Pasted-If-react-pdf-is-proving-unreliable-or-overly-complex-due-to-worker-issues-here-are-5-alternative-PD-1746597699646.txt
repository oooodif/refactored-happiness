If react-pdf is proving unreliable or overly complex due to worker issues, here are 5 alternative PDF viewer solutions—sorted by ease of use and feature set—that might work better depending on your project:

⸻

1. PDF.js (Vanilla JS) – No React Dependency
	•	What: The core library behind react-pdf, but you use it directly.
	•	Why it might be better: You avoid worker integration headaches by using Mozilla’s official viewer page or embedding the viewer as an iframe.
	•	Use case: Quick, standalone PDF rendering with minimal setup.
	•	Example:

<iframe src="/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=/example.pdf" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

2. ViewerJS
	•	What: Combines PDF.js and OpenDocument viewing in a clean, embeddable format.
	•	Why: Very simple. No workers to configure.
	•	Use case: Drop-in viewer for static PDFs.
	•	Usage:

<iframe src="/ViewerJS/#../docs/sample.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" allowfullscreen></iframe>

3. PDFObject
	•	What: Lightweight JavaScript utility to embed PDFs using the native browser viewer.
	•	Why: Zero dependency—uses <embed> or <iframe>.
	•	Use case: When browser support is sufficient (i.e., you don’t need custom rendering).
	•	Code:

<div id="pdf-viewer"></div>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdfobject/2.2.7/pdfobject.min.js"></script>
<script>PDFObject.embed("/example.pdf", "#pdf-viewer");</script>

4. react-pdf-viewer
	•	What: A fully featured alternative to react-pdf.
	•	Why: Includes built-in toolbar, search, zoom, thumbnails, and works well with custom workers.
	•	Install:

npm install @react-pdf-viewer/core @react-pdf-viewer/default-layout


	•	Use:

import { Viewer, Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';
import '@react-pdf-viewer/core/lib/styles/index.css';
import '@react-pdf-viewer/default-layout/lib/styles/index.css';

<Worker workerUrl="https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@3.4.120/build/pdf.worker.min.js">
  <Viewer fileUrl="/example.pdf" />
</Worker>
