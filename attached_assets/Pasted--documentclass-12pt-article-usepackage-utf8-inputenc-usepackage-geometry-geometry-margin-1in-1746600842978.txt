But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the allurements of pleasure that they cannot forebear to live and enjoy.

\section{The Pursuit of Pleasure}

No one can deny that the pursuit of pleasure is a fundamental aspect of human nature. We all seek to experience pleasure and avoid pain, and it is only natural that we should do so. However, the question remains as to whether we can pursue pleasure rationally, or whether we are doomed to suffer the consequences of our own desires.

\section{The Consequences of Pleasure}

As we have seen, the pursuit of pleasure can lead to consequences that are extremely painful. However, it is also true that the avoidance of pain can lead to a life of dullness and monotony. The key, then, is to find a balance between the two, and to pursue pleasure in a way that is rational and responsible.
